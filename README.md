# Hackaton21
Any educational institution is interested in the least possible number of students leaving the educational institution before the end of the entire period of studying. Entrance tests serve as a mean to help predict whether the student will cope with the educational program. A machine analysis of entrance tests results - like any other information regarding a student - can help predict whether a potential student will reach the end of the course.

The development of a model, the purpose of which is to predict whether the student will be expelled before the end of the term of study, is now up no you. Perhaps it will be your model that will help make the selection system for students of School 21 a bit more perfect.
